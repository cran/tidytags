You may also wish to try some general troubleshooting strategies:

- Try to find out what the specific problem is
  -  Identify what is *not* causing the problem
- "Unplug and plug it back in" - restart R, close and reopen R
- Reach out to others! Sharing what is causing an issue can often help to clarify the problem.
