**tidytags should be used in strict accordance with Twitter's [developer terms](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/more-on-restricted-use-cases).**

Although most Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) consider the Twitter data that **tidytags** analyzes to _not_ necessarily be human subjects research, there remain ethical considerations pertaining to the use of the **tidytags** package that should be discussed. 

Even if **tidytags** use is not for research purposes (or if an IRB determines that a study is not human subjects research), "the release of personally identifiable or sensitive data is potentially harmful," as noted in the [rOpenSci Packages guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/policies.html#ethics-data-privacy-and-human-subjects-research). Therefore, although you _can_ collect Twitter data (and you _can_ use **tidytags** to analyze it),    we urge care and thoughtfulness regarding how you analyze the data and communicate the results. In short, please remember that most (if not all) of the data you collect may be about people---and [those people may not like the idea of their data being analyzed or included in research](https://doi.org/10.1177/2056305118763366). 

We recommend [the Association of Internet Researchers' (AoIR) resources related to conducting analyses in ethical ways](https://aoir.org/ethics/) when working with data about people. AoIR's [ethical guidelines](https://aoir.org/reports/ethics3.pdf) may be especially helpful for navigating tensions related to collecting, analyzing, and sharing social media data.
